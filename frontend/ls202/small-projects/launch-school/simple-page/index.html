  <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> from a <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking at <a href="https://www.launchschool.com">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot! Why don't you
    join me?

  <p class="main-p">
    There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML &amp;
    CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color
    than the first - the "class" attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS
    will help accomplish that.
  </p>
  <p class="main-p" id="final-p">
  This is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well as an
  `id` attribute. We'll use some CSS and the `id` attribute to underline the
  entire paragraph.
